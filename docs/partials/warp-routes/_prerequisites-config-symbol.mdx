## Prerequisites

- The warp route config generated by `hyperlane warp init`.
    - This config is used to deploy a warp route. By default, it takes the filepath of `CURRENT_DIR/configs/warp-route-deployment.yaml`.
    - Alternatively, the config can be generated using `hyperlane warp read` if it exists in the Registry.
- The warp route token symbol used in `hyperlane warp deploy`.
    - The token symbol can be found onchain, or in your local Hyperlane Registry. By default, it is written to `$HOME/.hyperlane/deployments/warp_routes/<tokenSymbol>`.
- Access to the private key that currently owns the warp route.
